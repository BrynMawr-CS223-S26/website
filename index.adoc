== Course Info

**Welcome to CS223: Systems Programming**! 

image::matrix_original.jpg[]

Systems programming is the foundation of all software and toolkits that serve as 
infrastructure for other software, such as compilers,
operating systems, networking APIs, and graphics engines. Systems programming directly 
interacts with machine characteristics and low-level data types. Class topics include
pointers, bit representations of data, x86_64 assembly, memory management,
processes, and threads.  In this class, students will gain hands-on experience
implementing low-level algorithms and data structures using C. Additionally,
students will build technical skills related to makefiles, interactive
debugging, version control, and command-line shell interaction. C++ and STL
will be introduced at the end of the course.
